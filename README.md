# Project Overview

This repository is a **Remix/Vite web application** written in **TypeScript**. The `package.json` at the root lists scripts for development (`npm run dev`), building, and starting the server, along with numerous React and UI-related dependencies. The `README.md` provides instructions for running the development server and building the application for production.

## Project Structure

The application uses **Tailwind CSS** (configured in `tailwind.config.ts`) and places all source code under the `app/` directory. The key directories include:

* **components/** – React components ranging from general UI primitives (`app/components/ui/`) to feature-specific components like product gallery, cart, and checkout forms.
* **context/** – React context providers, such as shopping cart state management.
* **data/** – Placeholder utilities for fetching mock product data.
* **hooks/** – Custom React hooks for loading product-related data.
* **layouts/** – Layout components including common headers and footers.
* **routes/** – Remix route modules, including home page, product pages, cart, checkout, and registration flows. The cart route, for example, interacts with cart context for updates and checkout navigation.

## Entry Files and Utilities

* **Entry Files:**

  * `entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx` bootstrap Remix on client and server, respectively.
  * `root.tsx` injects environment variables (`PUBLIC_API_URL`) into the client and wraps pages with the cart provider.

* **Utilities:**

  * Custom `HttpClient` wrapper around Axios for API calls.
  * `UrlBuilder` utility for constructing API endpoints with environment variables.

## Public Assets

* `public/` folder holds static assets including logos, icons, and placeholder images.

## Important Points

### Remix Routing

Each file under `app/routes/` defines a specific route. For example, `products.$id.tsx` loads product details, related products, and categories before rendering the product page.

### Mock Data & Services

* `app/data/product.ts` contains mock arrays of products, brands, and categories, intended as placeholders until replaced with actual API data.
* `services/` directory includes functions such as `getProductById`, leveraging `UrlBuilder` and `HttpClient` for data fetching.

### State Management

* `app/context/cart-context.tsx` manages cart logic and persists state using local storage, making it accessible across various routes for cart display and checkout.

### UI Components

* Reusable UI components are located in `app/components/ui`, mostly wrappers around **Radix UI** or custom components styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
* Feature components (`product-gallery.tsx`, `product-info.tsx`, `registration-form.tsx`) compose these primitives into cohesive pages.

### Configuration

* `vite.config.ts` sets up Remix’s integration with Vite.
* `tailwind.config.ts` specifies the design system, colors, and themes.
* `tsconfig.json` contains TypeScript configuration.

### Environment Handling

* Environment variables (e.g., `PUBLIC_API_URL`) are injected via the loader in `root.tsx` for client-side availability.

## Next Steps for Learning

1. **Understand Remix Conventions:**

   * Explore Remix loaders, actions, and route modules using existing project routes as examples.

2. **Explore UI Libraries:**

   * Gain familiarity with **Radix UI** and **Tailwind CSS** to facilitate customization.

3. **Replace Mock Data:**

   * Transition from mock data in `app/data/` to real API calls using the services in conjunction with the `HttpClient`.

4. **State and Local Storage:**

   * Review how the cart context manages persistent state across sessions using local storage.

5. **Environment & Deployment:**

   * Inspect how environment variables (`PUBLIC_API_URL`) are managed and adjust accordingly for deployment scenarios.

Overall, the project follows a typical Remix e-commerce structure, combining UI components, context providers, and route modules. With proficiency in Remix’s data loading and component management, you can evolve the mock data services to real APIs, integrate authentication, or enhance the design system.
